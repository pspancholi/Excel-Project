# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis Dashboard  
### Public Health Reporting using Excel (2020–2021)

## 📌 Project Overview

An Excel-based global pandemic analysis project simulating a Junior Data Analyst role supporting a public health agency.

The dashboard evaluates infection spread, recovery performance, and mortality risk using structured calculations and visual reporting.

---
